#### [Hierarchical Quantized Representations for Script Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09542)
- this paper is about script induction, where they try to predict the next event based on context. in this work, they solved two problems: (1) previous works can only generate locally coherent script (2) previous works ignore the hierachical structure of script. so they proposed a hierachical quatitive autoencoder model to model the script inner structures. but the results are not so illusing and they didn't define their problem clearly.
