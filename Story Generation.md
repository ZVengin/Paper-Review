### Theme-based story generation
#### [Hierarchical Quantized Representations for Script Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09542)
- this paper is about script induction, where they try to predict the next event based on context. in this work, they solved two problems: (1) previous works can only generate locally coherent script (2) previous works ignore the hierachical structure of script. so they proposed a hierachical quatitive autoencoder model to model the script inner structures. but the results are not so illusing and they didn't define their problem clearly. 

#### [Hierarchical Neural Story Generation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1082.pdf)
- this paper solves the problem that the generated story is not closedly related to the given pompt, therefore, they introduce fusion mechansim in their work. So in their work, they first generate the prompt which captures the main contents of the story and generate the story following the prompt using fusion model. They also collect a story generate dataset. 

#### [A Skeleton-Based Model for Promoting Coherence Among Sentences in Narrative Story Generation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1462.pdf)
- this paper solves the problem that the sentences in generated story should have semantic connections, where semantic connections denote that . so they proposed skeleton-based model for promoting coherence among sentences. in their model, they first learning to generate skeleton using RL and extend skeleton to stories. the skeleton means the key words or phrases in sentences.

### Story-line based story generation


### Interaction based story generation
#### [Plan, Write, and Revise: an Interactive System for Open-Domain Story Generation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-4016.pdf)
- This paper deveoped an interactive story generation system, where user can control the story generation and revise the generated story through the webpage interface. there are two types of interactions, one is model-cross interaction where user can choose the story generated by different models and control the diversity of story. the other one is inter-model interaction where user can modify both the story line and the story itself of the selected story, including inserting, deleting and modifying.  


### Revise story generation
#### [Content Planning for Neural Story Generation with Aristotelian Rescoring](https://2021.eacl.org/committees/program)
- This paper try to revise the plot of the generated stories. according to the characteristirc of a good story plot, they design a a set of ranking models to assign a score to each possible plot for each given prompt. they find the best story plot by ranking candidate plots according to the average score over all ranking models.
- from their example, there many repeatition of contents, missing details about events, the order of events may be chaotic.  


### Event to sentence
#### [Story Realization: Expanding Plot Events into Sentences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03480.pdf)
- This paper forces models to include input event into the sentence using five different models.
