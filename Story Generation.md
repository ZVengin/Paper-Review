### Theme-based story generation
#### [Hierarchical Quantized Representations for Script Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09542)
- this paper is about script induction, where they try to predict the next event based on context. in this work, they solved two problems: (1) previous works can only generate locally coherent script (2) previous works ignore the hierachical structure of script. so they proposed a hierachical quatitive autoencoder model to model the script inner structures. but the results are not so illusing and they didn't define their problem clearly. 

### Story-line based story generation


### Interaction based story generation
#### [Plan, Write, and Revise: an Interactive System for Open-Domain Story Generation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-4016.pdf)
- This paper deveoped an interactive story generation system, where user can control the story generation and revise the generated story through the webpage interface. there are two types of interactions, one is model-cross interaction where user can choose the story generated by different models and control the diversity of story. the other one is inter-model interaction where user can modify both the story line and the story itself of the selected story, including inserting, deleting and modifying.
