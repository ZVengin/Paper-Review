  1. this paper is about paraphrase which aims to paraphrase the input sentence to the target sentence, however, existing works focus on generating the target sentence from scratch, which is different from the way that human does. Following the way of human, they provide a set of paraphrase phrases pairs as candidates to their model, and their model choose the appropriate ones to replace the phrases in the input sentence. 
  2. from their experiment results, it is obvious that not all paraphrase candidates are adopted in target sentence.
